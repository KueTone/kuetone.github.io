            </h1>
            <p>
              Thanks for dropping by! Welcome to my first website, where I hope
              to embark on a fulfilling journey as a software developer. I have
              always been one to explore different subjects either as a way to
              express my creativity or to discover myself, be it sports, books,
              art, music, woodworking, robotics, and now programming. I carry
              these skills and experiences with me and employ them in whatever
              project I undertake.
              <br /><br />
              During high school, I discovered my passion for creating through a
              makerspace called MakeX which exposed me to unfamiliar fields like
              aeronautics and robotics, taught me collaboration on long-term
              projects, and improved my communication abilities.
              <br /><br />
              Though I initially hesitated to get into computer programming, I
              took the chance during COVID-19's quarantine by managing my
              robotics team's website. It introduced me to HTML, CSS, backend
              deployment, and the value of seeking help from others.
              <br /><br />
              Fast forward to university, I chose Computer Engineer as my major.
              I hope to leverage my previous broad experiences in order to be a
              more cohesive Full-Stack Developer.
