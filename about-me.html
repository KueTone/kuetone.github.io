            <h1><b> <i>About</i></b></h1>

            <p>Thanks for dropping by! Welcome to my first website, where I hope to embark on a fulfilling journey as a software developer.</p>

            <p>I have always been one to explore different subjects either as a way to express my creativity or to discover myself, be it sports, books, art, music, woodworking, robotics, and now programming. I carry these skills and experiences with me and employ them in whatever project I undertake.</p>

            <p>During high school, I discovered my passion for creating through a makerspace called MakeX which exposed me to unfamiliar fields like aeronautics and robotics, taught me collaboration on long-term projects, and improved my communication abilities.</p>

            <p>Though I initially hesitated to get into computer programming, I took the chance during COVID-19's quarantine by managing my robotics team's website. It introduced me to HTML, CSS, backend deployment, and the value of seeking help from others.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to university, I chose Computer Engineer as my major with a minor in Computer Science. I hope to leverage my previous broad experiences in order to be a more cohesive Full-Stack Developer.</p>

            <!-- <p>Hello! Thanks for dropping by! </p>

            <p>Welcome to my first website and hopefully just the start in my journey as a software developer. </p>

            <p>I have always been one to explore different subjects either as a way to express my creativity or to discover myself, be it sports, books, art, music, woodworking, robotics, and now programming. I carry these skills and experiences with me and employ them in whatever project I undertake. </p>

            <p>At the start of my high school career, I discovered my passion for creating through a local makerspace called MakeX. Through this community, I was able to branch into different fields I would've never thought I would enjoy like aeronautics and robotics. These experiences not only helped me learn 3D-modeling and collaborate on long-term projects, but also improved my ability to effectively communicate and express my ideas to others. </p>

            <p>While I was able to nurture my creativity, I wasn't able to get into the field of computer programming. Even though there were many opportunnities that came my way, regretfully, I didn't have the courage to take that first step, thinking I was too inadequate or inferior to other students my age or even younger doing the same thing or achieving even more. I deluded myself into thinking that I had to prioritize other things like my studies or clubs, but in reality I thought that I didn't have any talent in the field. </p>

            <p>I was finally able to get my foot in the door by taking a job as the website manager at my robotics team during the coronavirus quarantine, completely different from what I was working on previously which were drivetrains and manufacturing. While it wasn't an "important" role like a project lead or team captain, I was satisfied that I didn't let this opportunity slip by unlike previously. It was through this position that I was introduced to HTML and CSS and learned a bit of the inner workings of backend deployment which included FTP Clients such as FireZilla and web hosting companies like GoDaddy. In addition, it also motivated me to go out of my way to ask for help from near strangers, as well as stood up for changes that I wanted to be implemented. </p>
