            <center><h1><b> <i>About me</i></b></h1></center>
            <h4>Beginning</h4><br>
            <p>Hello! Thanks for dropping by! </p>

            <p>Welcome to my first website and hopefully just the start in my journey as a software developer. </p>

            <p>I have always been one to explore different subjects either as a way to express my creativity or to discover myself, be it sports, books, art, music, woodworking, robotics, and now programming. I carry these skills and experiences with me and employ them in whatever project I undertake. </p>

            <p>At the start of my high school career 7 years ago, I discovered my passion for creating through a local makerspace called MakeX. Through this community, I was able to branch into different fields I would've never thought I would enjoy like aeronautics and robotics. These experiences not only helped me learn 3D-modeling and collaborate on long-term projects, but also improved my ability to effectively communicate and express my ideas to others. </p>

            <p>While I was able to nurture my creativity, I wasn't able to get into the field of computer programming. Even though there were many opportunnities that came my way, regretfully, I didn't have the courage to take that first step, thinking I was too inadequate or inferior to other students my age or younger doing the same thing or achieving even more. I deluded myself to say that I had to prioritize other things like my studies or other projects, but in reality I thought that I didn't have any talent in the field. </p>

            <p>I was finally able to get my foot in the door by taking a job as the website manager at my robotics team during the coronavirus quarantine, completely different from what I was working on previously which were drivetrains and manufacturing. While it wasn't an "important" role like Controls Lead or Team Captain and was actually previously neglected, I was satisfied that I didn't let this opportunity slip by like previous others. Through this position, I was introduced to rudimentary html and css and learned a bit of the inner workings of backend deployments like FireZilla. In addition it also pushed me to ask for help on problems I had no idea on where to start on and reaching out to people in order to push for progress on a certain aspect.  </p>


Certainly! Here's an example of an "About Me" page for an aspiring computer engineer:

Welcome to my page! I'm [Your Name], an aspiring Computer Engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the world of computers and how they have the power to transform lives and drive advancements in various industries.
