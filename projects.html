            <p>
              I wanted to create a property management web application for my
              mom. My MVP for the project was to be able to store vacant units
              that could be filtered and sorted through SQL queries and
              displayed to the user. In addition, I wanted to allow the
              homeowner to be able to edit their listing, whether it be to not
              show it, delete it, or modify certain details which required me to
              have multiple screens.

            <p>Philippines Tsunami Comparison</p>
            <p>
              This was a capstone project for my class on ocean modeling where
              we used Jupyter Notebooks, Python, numerical model from MITgcm,
              bathymetry data (depth of a body of water) from GEBCO, and initial
              conditions (temperature, salt, wind, current, etc.) from ECCO. I
              was interested in the effects of how different factors could
              affect the frequency of Typhoons and other natural disasters on
              the Philippine Region. More specifically, I wanted to know if
              global warming truly affected the frequency of when Typhoons form.
              <br />

              I constructed my model on the Philippines and surrounding regions
              and ran the model for two separate years,
              <b>1998 and 2011</b>, where La Nina occured for both years, in
              order to decrease variables. I anticipate the model to have an
              increase in Typhoon activity over the years due to an increase in
              global temperatures of 0.1&deg;C. In hindsight, I should have
              chosen a better set of dates as I didn't realize that these two
              years fell under a global warming hiatus that happened from 1998
              to 2014.

              <br />I encountered many stumbling blocks while creating my model
              and plotting out the data. I outlined many of them in the Readme
              in my Projects folder. Not only that, but my output didn't align
              with logical reasoning either. In my conclusion notebook, I
              noticed that there were too many dips in the Sea Surface height
              which didn't align with the corresponding year's tsunami count,
              and the temperature that was modeled weren't following the
              Philippines temperatures for that year either as it showed a large
              decline from January to April and the average temperature was too
              low for the Philippines throughout the year.

              <br />
              While there were many issues that I faced, with many of them
              resulting from my own inexperience, I learned a lot through my
              journey, from learning how to navigate and utilize my school's
              computing cluster through the terminal, but also deepening my
              understanding of the ocean and its diverse systems through working
              with ocean datasets and with tools used in ocean modeling such as
              bathymetry mapping and open boundary condition setup. This project
              taught me how to approach large environmental datasets, break down
              complex computational workflows, and better appreciate the
              intricacies of regional ocean circulation.

            <p>
              LifeTone is a university capstone project aimed at making
              personalized skincare advice more accessible and affordable. The
              app combined AI-powered recommendations, facial analysis, and a
              user-friendly interface to provide tailored skincare solutions
              that were previously out of reach for many due to high costs or
              exclusivity. I learned a lot during the project, from using React
              Native and Javascript for the first time, to creating our own
              machine learning model to generate product recommendations.
              <br />Currently the team and I are working towards getting our
              paper submitted into the CSCSU (Computer Science Conference for
              CSU Undergraduates). <br />
              UPDATE: Our paper was accepted to the 2025 CSCSU Undergraduate
              Conference! <br />
